#Excercise of for loop using the tuple A as a output. 
#a it's defined when you start the "for" loop and start at 0.
A=[1,2,3,4,5]
for a in range(0,5):
    print(A[a])
## The easiest way to use the for is assigning the A value to the a in the "for" loop. 
A=[1,2,3,4,5]
for a in A:
    print(a)
